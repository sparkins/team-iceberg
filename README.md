Our first group project

#Built a Gaming Platform

APIs used:  OKAPI - for timezone data
			Openweathermap API - for local weather information
			youTube API - to provide music and sound effects

Data Persistence:	localStorage was used to persist the current                       users username, no need to re-enter each time
                    Firebase was used to store the username and score, so we could provide a leaderboard, as well as your personal top score, per game

New Library:		We used the underscore library, to help with                       filtering and sorting data for the                                 leaderboards

CSS Framework:	    We used Bootstrap to provide a clean,                              structure UI for our control panel

Repeating Element:	We used Bootstraps List Group (their version                       of a table), for the leaderboard
